It is incredibly fast, aggressive, and durable enough to withstand nuclear ordnance, but still has certain vulnerabilities. Its presence is often preluded by its constant monstrous roaring, which is often visible on a submarine's sonar due to its intensity. As they would say in Coalition NAVY academy. But this specimen appears to be different ... smarter and ... acts in non-animal-like nature?"
