The Endworm itself is a colossal behemoth, a 
serpent-like leviathan covered in an incredibly 
durable, stone-like armor shell. It is incredibly
fast, aggressive, and durable enough to withstand
nuclear ordnance, but still has certain
vulnerabilities. Its presence is often preluded by
its constant monstrous roaring, which is often 
visible on a submarine's sonar due to its intensity.
As they would say in Coalition NAVY academy.

But this specimen appears to be different ... smarter
and ... acts in non-animal-like nature?
