The Charybdis body appears as a large mass of 
dark tentacles serving for navigation, and ending
with a sharp point, reminiscent of a spear tip.
Its teeth and massive tongue are crimson red. 
Sailors will first see massive orange pings on 
the sonar that grow stronger the closer the
Charybdis is to the submarine. The sonar 
silhouette of the Charybdis resembles a massive 
dolphin.
As they would say in Coalition NAVY academy.

But this specimen appears to be different ... smarter
and ... acts in non-animal-like nature?
