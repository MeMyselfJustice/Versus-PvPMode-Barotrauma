# Versus PvP Mode for Barotrauma

One of the closest analogs of this mod is <b>Left 4 Dead's Versus</b> PvP mode.<br>

## Gamelpay

One team is Human submarine squad and second team is The Great Yibaka (ukr. Велика Їбака) class one-monster pack <b>controlled by another player</b>. There is safety in numbers, right ...<br>
Submarine Vs Big foul creature, to say shortly.

One team has to devastate another. Simple enough.
